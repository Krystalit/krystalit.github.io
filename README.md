(Some contents from my website)

/This article is about the situation of this website and something about me. Firstly, because of my studying plans, I don't have the energy to construct this website at a high speed,
**I don't know if I will make changes to this website even less frequent or abandon it in the future**.

/In about 2021, I tried to make a a website **for fun**,then I just made it through watching and reading tutorials. My academic stress was not so big at that time. Then later I just used it at my
personal homepage.Now I use this site as my personal homepage, and just trying to add some features to it, so this **may fail to meet your need**.
