    <h1>"Spring and Flowers' Dream" (《春江花月夜》)</h1>

    <div class="poP mid center">
        <p>The springing of the tide wakes the moonlight.</p>
        <p>The springing of the tides disturbs the peace of miles.</p>
        <p>In the vast ocean flow the waves of swinging bright.</p>
        <p>Nowhere in the river in spring is in the color of night.</p>
        <p>The river winds its through the wild of spring lifes.</p>
        <p>Moonlight shines on crowds of flowers like shreds of ice.</p>
        <p>The flowing frost in the air slipped away from the sight.</p>
        <p>The white sands in the shore are not possible to find.</p>
        <p>In the one color of river and sky no dust falling.</p>
        <p>Alone in the sky the moon is like a bright ring.</p>
        <p>But who by the river was the first to witness the scene.</p>
        <p>And when by the riverside did the moon first share her beam?
        <p>Life of generations and generations are without an end.</p>
        <p>For years and years the moon has stared at almost the same.</p>
        <p>Not knowing who is the riverside moon waiting for.</p>
        <p>There is only the river's long flowing visible.</p>
        <p>The only cloud moved, the whiteness went slow.</p>
        <p>On QingFeng Pu overwhelming sorrow grows.</p>
        <p>Out of whose house can we a tiny boat?
        <p>On whose wall can we see the moonlight pale?
        <p>Piteous is the moon around upstairs to pace.</p>
        <p>It should shine on the dressing table of who stayed.</p>
        <p>Inside the curtain on a frame of jade that she can't roll away.</p>
        <p>Wiping it out of the washing anvil, it would come again and will not fade.</p>
        <p>The look in each other's direction and hear no voice.</p>
        <p>I would see you bathe in the moonlight which I would chase.</p>
        <p>A giant swan goose fly to nowhere to break the light's surface.</p>
        <p>A dragon-like fish submerges and soars only to give strokes tin waves.</p>
        <p>Yesternight in the idle pond dreaming of fallen flowers.</p>
        <p>Piteous was the mid-spring without him in home of ours.</p>
        <p>Scents of spring flowing in the river, but soon they will die out.</p>
        <p>The moon headed west, in the pond it's her final hours.</p>
        <p>In the dense marine smoke hid the moon's leaning look.</p>
        <p>From Jieshi to Xiaoxiang is an infinte route.</p>
        <p>Not knowing how many will be carried by the returning moon.</p>
        <p>Emotions swang in the river's leaves as the falling moon shook.</p>
